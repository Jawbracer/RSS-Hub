      <h3>The Introduction</h3>
      <p>We are an online community of left wing people, we participate in a Government Simulation under the name of Lorvale Republic. 
         We are also gearing up to engage in real life advocacy and organising, and for this goal we need to build first. As a worker's party
         we abide by the teaching of Marx, Lenin and other great minds of the past, however we recognise that their time has passed and as such the party itself
         does not subscribe to any specific tendancy. We advocate for the rights of workers and their continued advancement in all it's multivariate forms.
      <h3>What we do</h3>
      <p>Beyond the fun and interesting activity of Government Simulation, we are gearing up to engage in real life organising. If this is something of interest to you then please contact 
         a member to talk about that you can do to engage if effective advocacy in your area. 
      </p>
      <h3>Core Values</h3>
      <p>At our core we are a worker's party, we uphold the rights of the worker and work toward their continued advancement, keeping in mind the teachings of Marx, Lenin and many others.
         If you are interested in reading more about us and our core values, then links are provided below.</p>
